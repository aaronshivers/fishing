    "description": "Lone Jack Lake Conservation Area is in southeastern Jackson County,one mile northwest of Lone Jack on Brown Road.\nThe area is located in a region rich in Civil War history. The Battle of Lone Jack was fought August 16, 1862 within the city limits of Lone Jack.\nThe Conservation Department purchased this 295-acre tract in 1983 to develop a lake site and provide additional fishing waters in Jackson County. A dam was constructed in 1985 and now impounds 35 acres of water. Fingerling largemouth bass, bluegill and channel catfish were stocked and the lake was opened to public fishing in 1989. Special features around the lake include a concrete boat launching ramp,two fishing jetties, one of which is designed for use by persons who are physically disabled. Both the entrance road and the major parking lot are paved with asphalt.\nThe area consists of 125 acres of woodlands, 65 acres of grassland, 35 acres of cropland,35 acres of old fields, a 1-acre pond (Cave Pond) by the entrance stocked with largemouth bass, bluegill and channel catfish, and 2 fishless ponds. Woodlands, crop fields, and native grasses are managed to provide year-round food and cover for a variety of game and non-game wildlife species. Haying and controlled burning are used to maintain plant diversity in open areas. Habitat plantings include native trees, shrubs, and grasses.\nA variety of waterfowl use the area for both nesting and wintering. The area also supports good populations of deer, wild turkey, quail, rabbits, and squirrels.",
